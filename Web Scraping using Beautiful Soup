Web Scraping Steam games site using BeautifulSoup
Steam is a popular video game digital distribution service where gamers view and download games of their interest. Due to the increase in E-Sports, there are a number of games which have caught the interest of youth of this generation.
Steam is home to a million games which are both Free to Play as well as purchase to play including all new releases, their ratings, reviews etc.
This project is about scraping steam website to extract information about all the games, their release date, reviews, platforms it can be played on and saving the data to a csv file for further processing.
The dataframe for the scrapped data is created and placed in the same folder as the notebook file. Once the data is saved to a csv file, it can be used for further processing e.g. building a recommendation system for games.
Please Note:
1. There are few records for which the user reviews might not be present as a % format. These records will be cleaned during data preprocessing.
2. For some records, the cost of game/software is not mentioned due to multiple prices(subscription packs). These will be handled during data wrangling.
